                <label>About YapLoud</label><br/>
                YapLoud is a FREE service that allows web users to connect with like-minded people on the fly.
                Today, as users are surfing through the web, they are unable to interact with the web content. 
                There is no way for people to talk about its content either with the website owner or with other surfers.
                YapLoud enables this. Users can no longer be passive readers of the content. Instead, they can identify
                what other Yappers are talking about and participate in the Yapper Community. They can also participate
                with the website owners directly.
                
                YapLoud empowers surfers to influence the content on any website.
