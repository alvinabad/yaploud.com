<p>
Niniane Wang, the person behind Google's new service called Lively, 
has been working on this confidential project since November 2005 according 
to her resume. There have been hints throughout the years that this might be

Granted, it's not exactly the same, but it's the foundation of a system that 
could easily go in that direction. This is a case, just like it was with 
Google Talk, that they are starting with a bare-bones service that will 
incorporate user suggestions over the next few years. This way the service is 
actually built without fat.
